# How To Focus On The Right Problems

## Intro (0:00)

Founders are often told that their best superpower is to delegate, but in reality, their superpower is their ability to get things done efficiently. However, they can't do everything, so they need to focus on a few key areas.

## Focus (0:54)

* **The importance of focus:** Just like with homework, you'll never get anything done until you focus and eliminate distractions. This applies to everyone, from individual contributors to CEOs.
* **Founder mode:**  Founders need to be focused on the core of their business, not distracted by noise.
* **Complexity vs. simplicity:**  Many successful business people, like Warren Buffett and Jeff Bezos, have simple strategies. Complexity doesn't equal winning.
* **Credit seeking:** In larger organizations, people often want to take credit for things, which can lead to a lack of focus.
* **Conventional wisdom:** The traditional view was that founders should focus on managing managers, not being in the weeds.
* **Founder's power:** Founders have a lot of influence in their company. For example, a CEO focused on sales can often close bigger deals than a junior salesperson.
* **Superpowers:** Founders have superpowers in terms of efficiency, but they need to choose where to focus them.

## Complexity (2:07)

* **When did complexity become equated with winning?** Many successful companies have simple strategies.
* **Focus is often an excuse:** People claim to be focused but aren't actually auditing their time and attention.

## Credit (3:18)

* **Credit seeking can lead to a lack of focus:**  People may try to add more to the agenda to take credit, even if it means spreading the company too thin.

## Force (4:42)

* **Founders are a powerful force in their company:** They can achieve a lot by focusing their energy on a specific area.
* **Example: Sales:** Founders focused on sales can often outperform large sales teams.

## Persona (6:41)

* **The "wantrepreneur":**  Someone who wants to start a startup but hasn't taken concrete steps. They often have complicated answers to simple questions.
* **The YC Alum:**  A founder who was focused during YC but has since become distracted by various issues and possibilities.

## Alum Persona (8:34)

* **Alums often struggle to maintain focus after YC:** They may overthink their strategy or get bogged down in details.

## Selling (10:48)

* **Founders should use their own product:** This helps them understand its value and identify areas for improvement.
* **Many founders don't use their own product:** They may not see themselves as a good judge of its quality.

## Year End Change (12:08)

* **Year-end is a good time to refocus:** Founders can take advantage of the holidays to reflect and re-prioritize.
* **People expect change at year-end:** This is a good opportunity to make changes without disrupting the team.

## No excuses (13:30)

* **Founders have the power to focus:** They don't need permission from anyone.
* **Focusing inspires others:** When founders focus, it sets a good example for the rest of the company.

## Simple (14:08)

* **The best companies often have the simplest explanations:**  Their meetings are short, and their goals are clear.

## Conclusion

Focus is essential for success. Founders need to identify the right problems to solve and then dedicate their energy to solving them. When founders are truly focused, their companies thrive.
